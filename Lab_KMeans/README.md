# Overview
The KMeans Lab Enhancement aims to improve upon the existing tutorial provided by the lecturer on the topic of KMeans clustering. Through optimizations and additional description, this project seeks to enhance the learning experience for students by providing a more comprehensive and insightful exploration of the KMeans algorithm.

# Improved
- Reduce complexity
- Improved flow
- Added more explanations and descriptions

# Contribution
Cham Hao Cheng (1211304951):
- KMeans with Blob Data
- KMeans with Real World Data
- Tuning KMeans Clustering Pipeline

# How to Run
Simply run the codes block by block.
