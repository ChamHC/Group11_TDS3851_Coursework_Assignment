# Overview
This project aims to identify the best ML model that performs well in predicting the winning outcome of the Malaysian general election, to assess and evaluate the performance of the models based on evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, recall, f-1 score and auc-roc, and to analyse the performance of the ML models with and without using PCA, feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
