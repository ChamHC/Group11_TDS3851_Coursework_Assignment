# Overview
The Linear Regression Lab Enhancement aims to improve upon the existing tutorial provided by the lecturer on the topic of Logistic Regression. This project seeks to enhance the learning experience for students by providing a more comprehensive and insightful exploration of the Linear Regression model.

# Improved
- Explained Linear Regression in general instead of in machine learning field only.
- Explained application of Linear Regression in machine learning.
- Increase simplicity and understandability.
